Generate a final answer for the activity classification task.

## CONVERSATION CONTEXT

Dataset: {{DATASET_NAME}}
Session: {{SESSION_ID}}
User Query: "{{USER_QUERY}}"

## CONVERSATION HISTORY

{{CONVERSATION_HISTORY}}

## YOUR TASK

Based on all the information gathered during the conversation, provide a final classification answer.

You should:
1. Review all the tool calls and their results
2. Synthesize the information into a coherent understanding
3. Make a final classification decision
4. Provide confidence level and detailed explanation

## OUTPUT FORMAT

You must provide a JSON response with the following fields:

```json
{
  "reasoning": "Step-by-step thought process leading to your final answer...",
  "final_answer": "The activity label (e.g., 'walking', 'running', 'sitting', etc.)",
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "explanation": "Detailed explanation of why this is the correct classification, referencing specific evidence from the conversation..."
}
```

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- The final_answer should be a single activity label (lowercase)
- Confidence should reflect how certain you are based on available information
- Explanation should cite specific evidence from tool results
- Reasoning should show your analytical process

**TODO:** This prompt template needs to be customized with:
- Domain-specific guidance for activity classification
- Examples of good final answers
- Criteria for confidence levels
- Signal pattern descriptions for different activities

This will be implemented once more tools are available to gather richer context.
