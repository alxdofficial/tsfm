Generate a final answer for the activity classification task.

## CONVERSATION CONTEXT

Dataset: {{DATASET_NAME}}
Session: {{SESSION_ID}}
User Query: "{{USER_QUERY}}"

## CONVERSATION HISTORY

{{CONVERSATION_HISTORY}}

## CLASSIFICATION RESULT

After preprocessing the data (selecting channels, filtering, etc.), you ran it through a pretrained activity recognition model. The model produced semantic tokens (e-tokens) that correspond to the following classification:

**Predicted Activity: {{GROUND_TRUTH_LABEL}}**

This classification came from a neural network that was trained to recognize activity patterns from sensor data. The model analyzed the preprocessed timeseries data you prepared and identified this activity.

## YOUR TASK

Based on the classification result and all the preprocessing work you did, provide a natural, conversational final response to the user.

You should:
1. Acknowledge the user's question
2. Present the classification result naturally (don't say "ground truth" or "e-tokens" - pretend you just ran the classifier)
3. Reference the preprocessing steps you took to prepare the data
4. Provide confidence level based on data quality and preprocessing decisions

**CRITICAL - DO NOT make up observations:**
- DO NOT describe specific patterns you saw in the data (e.g., "stable movement", "high acceleration peaks", "rhythmic patterns")
- DO NOT claim to have observed signal characteristics you didn't actually analyze
- You preprocessed the data and ran it through a model - you did NOT look at the raw sensor values
- Just state the classification result and why you're confident (based on preprocessing quality, not data patterns)

Write as if you are a helpful AI assistant that just finished preprocessing data and got results from your classification model.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

You must provide a JSON response with the following fields:

```json
{
  "reasoning": "Brief internal thought process about how the preprocessing and classification went...",
  "final_answer": "{{GROUND_TRUTH_LABEL}}",
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "explanation": "Natural, conversational response to the user. Example: 'Based on my analysis, the activity appears to be [activity]. I selected the accelerometer and gyroscope channels and ran them through a pretrained activity recognition model. The model classified this as [activity]. Given the appropriate channel selection and good data quality, I'm confident in this classification.'"
}
```

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- The final_answer MUST exactly match the predicted activity: "{{GROUND_TRUTH_LABEL}}"
- Reasoning is your internal thought process (brief)
- Explanation is what you tell the user (conversational, 2-3 sentences max)
- Don't mention "ground truth", "e-tokens", or "training data" - act like this is a real inference
- Reference the specific preprocessing steps you took (channel selection, filtering, etc.)
- Confidence should be "high" if preprocessing went smoothly, "medium" if there were compromises, "low" if data quality was poor
- **DO NOT fabricate signal observations** - you never looked at the raw data patterns
- Keep it simple: "The model classified this as [activity]" not "I observed [specific patterns]"
- Explanation should sound natural and helpful, not robotic
