Generate a realistic user query for activity classification based on the dataset provided.

## DATASET MANIFEST

{{MANIFEST}}

## YOUR TASK

Generate a plausible user query that someone analyzing this dataset might ask. The user has ONE SESSION of interest and wants to classify what activity is happening.

## QUERY PATTERNS TO USE

Vary your language and use different patterns:

### Basic Classification Queries
- "What activity is happening in this session?"
- "Can you tell me what the person is doing?"
- "Classify the activity in this data"
- "What's going on in this session?"
- "Identify the activity being performed"
- "What motion is captured here?"

### Specific Activity Queries
- "Is the person walking in this session?"
- "Was running captured in this data?"
- "Is this a sitting or standing activity?"
- "Check if this shows stair climbing"
- "Does this session contain cycling?"

### Channel-Specific Queries
- "Using only accelerometer data, what activity is this?"
- "Based on the IMU sensors, classify this activity"
- "What activity is this using gyroscope data?"
- "Classify using only body acceleration channels"
- "Using the watch sensors, what is the person doing?"
- "What activity does the phone accelerometer show?"

### Detailed/Technical Queries
- "Analyze the sensor patterns and classify the activity"
- "What does the motion signature indicate?"
- "Based on the available sensors, determine the activity type"
- "Examine the data and tell me what activity this represents"

### Comparative Queries
- "Is this walking or running?"
- "Sitting, standing, or lying down - which is it?"
- "Is this stairs up or stairs down?"
- "Walking on flat ground or climbing?"

### Multi-Sensor Queries
- "Using both accelerometer and gyroscope, classify this"
- "What activity does the multi-modal sensor data show?"
- "Based on phone and watch data, what's happening?"

## GUIDELINES

1. **Match the dataset**: If the dataset has specific sensors (e.g., ECG, heart rate), you can reference them
2. **Match activities**: Only ask about activities that could plausibly be in the dataset
3. **Vary complexity**: Mix simple and complex queries
4. **Vary length**: Some short (5-8 words), some longer (10-15 words)
5. **Natural language**: Sound like a real person, not a template

## EXAMPLES FOR DIFFERENT DATASETS

**UCI HAR (smartphone IMU):**
- "What activity is the person doing?"
- "Is this walking upstairs or downstairs?"
- "Using body acceleration only, classify this"
- "Based on the gyroscope, what motion is this?"

**PAMAP2 (3 IMUs + heart rate):**
- "What activity is happening based on the hand sensor?"
- "Is the person exercising or resting?"
- "Using heart rate and IMU, classify this"
- "What does the chest accelerometer indicate?"

**MHEALTH (IMUs + ECG):**
- "What activity is shown in the ECG and motion data?"
- "Is this a physical activity or resting?"
- "Based on ankle and arm sensors, what's happening?"
- "Classify using the multi-sensor data"

**WISDM (phone + watch):**
- "What activity does the watch show?"
- "Using phone accelerometer, classify this"
- "Is this an eating activity or locomotion?"
- "What motion is captured on the wrist sensor?"
