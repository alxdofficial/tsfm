"""
Variable-length windowing for HAR datasets.

Provides activity-aware window sizing with random overlap for training diversity.
Window durations are tuned based on activity complexity:
- Simple activities (walking, sitting): 2-20s windows
- Complex activities (cooking, cleaning): 10-90s windows

The max session duration is capped at 90 seconds to fit within the model's
context window (~45 patches at ~2 seconds each).
